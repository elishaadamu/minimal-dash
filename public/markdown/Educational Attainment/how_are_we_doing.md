The percentage of the region's residents (25 years or older) that have completed high school has risen by exactly 10 percentage points, from 82.2% in 2000 to 92.2% in 2023. For educational attainment by regional Planning Area, however, a large disparity remains between educational levels attained in the region's Core Cities compared to Developed Communities, Growing Suburbs, and Rural Areas. Although the high school completion rate has risen to 86.2% in Core Cities based on 2019–2023 five-year estimates, this still significantly lags behind the 93.8% and 95.7% rates in Developed Communities and Growing Suburbs, respectively.

The number of residents in the region with a bachelor's degree or higher has also continued to grow. In 2000, just over one million residents had at least a bachelor's degree. In 2023, the number of people with a bachelor’s degree or higher increased by 76% to 1.77 million.
