Collaborating with our county partners, DVRPC produced the 2050 v2.0 [county and municipal employment forecasts](https://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/popempforecasts/) for the *Update: Connections 2050* Long-Range Plan that were adopted by the DVRPC Board.

Fostering a higher population and supporting an older population in the future can be best achieved through Smart Growth strategies, which help to minimize impacts to the environment and open space, while building more compact and walkable communities. Smart Growth strategies in the Municipal Implementation Toolbox include:
