Greater Philadelphia’s population is growing moderately, while becoming older and more diverse. The region's population grew by 570,000 people between 2000 and 2024—an increase of about 10.6% total or 0.4% per year. The region’s Pennsylvania suburban counties grew by 14.4% over that period, versus the region’s New Jersey counties, which grew by 11.3%. From 2000 to 2023, the latest year of municipal population data, the region’s Growing Suburbs grew by 26.6%, versus the region’s Core Cities which grew by 1.7%. 

The county population by change components shows most counties in the region had a positive natural increase—meaning they have more births than deaths—between 2020 and 2023. Bucks County has been the exception to this as it had more deaths than births from 2020 to 2023. Still, overall growth for the county was positive in these years, because net migration outweighed the negative natural increase.

The 65-plus population grew by 43.2% from 2000 to 2023, the most of any age group, versus those under 20 years old, which decreased by 7.0% over the same period.
